# Diagrams

**Language Namespace :** `de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram`

With the diagrams language it is possible to graphically edit your metamodel. The screenshot below shows a graphical diagram model of an example language. The diagram to the right is a graphical representation of the textual model on the left. This example is taken from the ``de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram.demoentities.sandbox`` solution.

## Download
Download the nightly build of the plugins from the [release page](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions/releases).

## Examples
The example languages ``de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram.demolang``, ``de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram.demo.*`` ([link](https://github.com/JetBrains/MPS-extensions/tree/master/code/diagram/languages)) give a good overview of the diagram language's features.

## Installation
Extract the downloaded *de.itemis.mps.extensions* package and copy its content into your local MPS installation directory into the *plugins* folder (e.g. ``\JetBrains\MPS 2020.2\plugins``). Check the installation by opening MPS, navigate to ``Settings -> Plugins -> Other Tools`` and find *de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram* in there.

## Features
![](/diagrams/diagrams-features.png)

This screenshot shows a few interesting features: you can embed diagrams anywhere in "text", you can use different shapes (at this point drawn by custom Java code), you can use various line styles, the framework supports ports (i.e., connection endpoints on the boxes), inside boxes you can use arbitrary MPS text (or other) editors, and the system also supports edge and endpoint labels. Port labels are also supported, but they are only shown if the mouse is "in the vicinity" of the port to not clutter the diagram. The screenshot is taken with the mouse hovering over the *out1* port and represents an example model of the *de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram.demolang* language.

This one illustrates that the approach scales to reasonable sizes, shows that zooming is supported and also demonstrates the auto layouting capability. The graphical notation also integrates with things such as tooltips. 

##General Information
The definition of a graphical editor is based on the same "cell" abstraction used in other MPS editors: the language for defining editors contains additional cells that are then rendered as a diagram (diagram, diagram.box, diagram.edge). Similar to tables, these abstractions for defining graphical editors rely on queries to make sure that the structure of the graphical editor does not have to directly correspond to the structure of the AST (for example, in terms of ownership). The language also supports hierarchical diagrams, for example, in state machines.

##Diagram Creation Example - Step by Step
In the following section a step by step guide for a simple graph language is presented. You can find the source code for the example in this [repository](https://github.com/tillschallau/mps-diagrams). If you are familiar with the diagram extension and search for a more advanced example, head over to [DSL Foundry](http://dslfoundry.com/using-the-diagram-editor-and-querylist-lets-build-a-graphical-structure-editor-for-mps/) where the MPS concept modelling is enhanced to be edited with the diagram editor. 

### Concepts
For our small example we introduce three concepts fundamental for graphs and diagrams. First we need **nodes** and **edges**. 
The **node** concept is a simple concept implementing the INamedConcept interface which gives the concept a **name** attribute.

The concept **edge** functions as a connection between nodes. Therefore the edge concept contains two references **from** and **to**, each one pointing to the node concept.

These two concepts do not build a diagram automatically but there has to be a designated parent concept, in this case the **graph** concept. The **graph** concept is set to be the root concept and contains a list of nodes and edges as children.

With these concepts the basic graph structure is complete. The more interesting part of diagram creation is situated in the concept's editors.

### Editors
To get access to the diagram editor templates you have to import the ``de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram`` language. Either add it via the Model properties of the editor model, or by opening the *Import language or devkit* menu (Win: ``Ctrl+L``, MacOs: ``âŒ˜+L``). Make sure that the *Include non-project modules* checkbox is checked.

The import of said language gives you four editor templates usable to create diagrams in MPS. Three of these are explained in more detail with their respective concept instantiation.

Let's start by defining the editor for the node concept. Each instance of this concept should be displayed as some sort of a shape (box, circle, triangle, etc.). The diagram language uses the ``diagram.box`` editor template to describe such representations. In the screenshot below the editor for the node concept is visualized. For the first example only the *editor* part is filled in. This field allows MPS cell models (such as node cells, collections, constants, etc.) to be entered. The property declaration of the node's name is sufficient to demonstrate the *editor's* effect on the diagram editor.

To display visual edges between nodes, the ``de.itemis.mps.editor.diagram`` language uses the ``diagram.edge`` editor template. The minimum requirement to create edges is the declaration of *from* and *to* targets. As you can see in the screenshot below only these two fields are filled in. Note that you first have to declare the type of the target. It is possible to choose between *box* and *port* (where port is a designated part of a box, as you can see in the screenshot above) and an *if* decision. While the latter is only used to add more flexibility, the former are used to actually connect the edge to diagram objects. In our case we are connecting to *boxes*. To get the current edge concept the diagram language uses the constant **thisNode**. This constant is also used in the other editor templates. With this we can select our references *from* and *to* at their respective place.

To bring these editors together into on diagram editor, the overlying *graph* concepts needs its own editor.
For this purpose the ``diagram`` editor template is introduced. Firstly we need to define the content of the diagram, by adding the children of the *graph* concept *nodes* and *edges* to the *content* section. For a more in-depth view of the usage of query languages to add instances to the diagram refer to [DSL Foundry](http://dslfoundry.com/using-the-diagram-editor-and-querylist-lets-build-a-graphical-structure-editor-for-mps/). The *connection creators* are necessary to synchronize the underlying model with its diagram representation. For this cause we have to specify between which concepts a specific edge can be created. In our example the *from concept* and *to concept* are the *node* concept. The *create* field contains the information necessary for storing the change in the underlying model. To persist the newly added edge we have to create a new edge and assign the connected concepts to their respective references in the *edge* concept. To complete the diagram editor, we add a *palette entry*. With this it is possible to drag and drop specific concepts onto the diagram, which are then automatically added to the underlying model. We only want the create *node* concept instances with this method, therefore only these concept instances are allowed in the palette. The palette entries can be found on right side of your MPS IDE below the *Context actions* if you are in the editor of your diagram language.

This concludes this small example with the following end result. You can see three node which were created by dragging them onto the diagram board. The nodes *Start* and *End* have their *name* attribute already set, whereas the third node still shows the editor for the property. The create an edge between two nodes, click on one node and click the button highlighted in the screenshot. Dragging the edge connector to another node is then creating the edge.
